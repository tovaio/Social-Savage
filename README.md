Project for Vandy Hacks VI: Art Edition

## How to build and run

Open a terminal, navigate to the repository directory, and run this command:

```
npm install
```

Then, to run the server in a development environment (meaning the webpage automatically updates with changes to components), run this command:

```
npm run server
```

To run it in production mode (not needed for the hackathon, but just in case):

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
